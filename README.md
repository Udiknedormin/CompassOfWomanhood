# Compass of Womanhood

"Compass of Womanhood" (COW, CoW, 6W), subtitled "Ways of Women, Ways of Pleasure", is a mod project for Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition.

Its goal is to create diverse cast of interesting and fitting female companions that fit well with both the Forgotten Realms lore and the base games. All the mods are, by design, dual-language — in most cases both the English and the Polish version can be considered "the original" (it's usually bolded when that isn't the case).


## Goal

To create diverse cast of interesting female companions that fit well with both the Forgotten Realms lore and the base games. We are drived by the respect for the original game and strive to pay this respect by creating seamless experience for the players.

We are trying our best for the mod content to be high-quality and well-researched, and for the characters to be compelling.

As a side goal, we wanted to start "from scratch", with no direct help from the experienced members of modding community — direct, because we use the tools created by them, as well as documentation, forum threads, tutorials etc — and we are grateful to the community for all of those tools and learning materials.


## List of companions

There are currently two companions developed as a part of this project, but additional companions may be added to the list:
 * [Shithri](./CompassOfWomanhood/Shithri_README.md) — vagabond half-orc pirate girl from Zhentil Keep. Worshipper of orcish goddess Luthic, Mother of Caves. She's free-spirited and loves a good drink (and is quite persistent with her offers of drinking). Speaks in heavy pirate accent (pirate dialect even, in Polish language version).
 * Caly — high-class courtesan from Calimshan who speaks in posh manner and is blessed with red heair, believed by some to be "the touch of [Sune](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sune)". Exclusive artiste and experienced story hunter. Worshipper of moon goddess [Selûne](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sel%C3%BBne), but touched by the shadows.
