Let’s turn back time and come back to Baldurs Gate 2. Impossible you say? Well… it is.", "We are a group of crazy people, who everyday thinks about (Sword Shore?). That’s why we moved our butts, and create something unusual, wonderful, marvelous and generally dope, and we mean modification for that classical game. We think of it when we do our dishes, sleep, and pumping score on mobile games while owning The throne.", "We, The fans, created for the fans all around the globe.

    "MOD": [
      "The project \"Compass of Womanhood\" subtitled \"Ways of Woman, Ways of Pleasure\" is a tribute to the already iconic game Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition.",
      "The vision of the mod is to create a variety of female companions, that will not only fit into the world of the Forgotten Realms, but also the game itself.  All components of the modification are bilingual by design - in most cases, both the English and Polish versions can be considered \"original\" (usually it is clearly indicated iif that's not the case).  There are currently two companions being created under the project, but the list may be extended.",
      "The first heroine is Shithri - a pirate, a vagabond and a connoisseur of a good toddy. She is a follower of the orcish goddess known as the Mother of Caves.  In Polish version, she speaks in a unique dialect of Polish language, dedicated for this initiative.",
      "The other character is Caly: well-read, educated and painfully professional. An exclusive courtesan with hair as fiery as her temperament. Knowledgeable in art and history. A follower of the moon goddess, seeking the way of her faith.",
      "Everyone will find something for themselves in the mod. Great drinks, sea shanties, lore of the sea and fairy tales from all over the world, broadly understood art, as well as pirate slang in both language versions. In a word, everything that we fell in love with Baldur's for."
